## Log management
- **ELK stack**: Filebeat, Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana
    -- Reads log data from Kubernetes log files.
- [**Elasticalert 2**](https://github.com/jertel/elastalert2): For setting up rules for alerting on anomalies based on data pulled from Elasticsearch. 
## Monitoring
- **Prometheus**: Monitores and exports metrics and insights in real time from a Kubernetes cluster as well as custom defined endpoint like microservices.
